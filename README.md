# angular-todo

  - This is a ToDo app that uses the angular framework.
  - To add a ToDo task enter text in the input field and press enter when done.
  - The double binding of the framework allows for asynchronous actions.  As such this page never reloads.
  - I'm using localStorage as the persistence layer of this ToDo.
